# internet-overdose
Plays INTERNET OVERDOSE when I've been on my computer too long

currently only supports linux because i run linux and i'm lazy

You will need to:
- Have python
- Download the song INTERNET OVERDOSE (from needy streamer overload)
- Save the song in this directory as `INTERNET_OVERDOSE.mp4`
- Have `mpv` to play the video
- Run `python main.py` and be off to the races! :)
